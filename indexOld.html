    <p>This website shows some of the projects I did during the year long extracurricular activity 
      "Creative Coding" in 2021/21. I hope you enjoy the artifacts, it was really fun to create them.</p>

    <p class="focus">During the year we did the following projects:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>About me</li>
      <li>Examples for Arcade Games</li>
      <li>A game with P5JS</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Our next topic will be audio and multimedia processing, we will use Audacity and MAX 8.</p>

    <h2>My first audio recording</h2>
    <p>This is a short recording done using the Ableton Learning Music website. The production was recorded with Audacity and
      its duration cut down to 5 seconds. Furthermore, I have added fade in and fade out.</p>
